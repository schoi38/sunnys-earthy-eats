GOALS:
Create an HTML website with and index page containing links to a few recipes
- practice working with anchors/links, lists, paragraphs, images, comments, and headings
- further familiarize with git overall and VSCode to git workflow
- don't push every commit. Push when project is complete.

DEBRIEF:
I created an index page with subsequent links to other pages for recipes (some of my go-tos for ease, time, health, and experience). I utilized and experimented with various headings, links/anchors, images, images as links, paragraphs, lists - ordered and unordered. I debugged a faulty link as I initially linked the incorrect directory and file. I sometimes forgot to atomically commit and push to GitHub, so I'm trying to stamp that into my muscle memory more. I'd love to learn to style webpages more with CSS because the bare bones look of these pages right now do not exactly meet my basic aesthetic standards.
